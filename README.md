# Green Hydrogen Dissertation Repository

This repository contains the datasets, economic model, and simulation results developed for my MSc dissertation at FCT NOVA: 
*"Economic Viability Study of Renewable Energy Conversion Systems into Green Gases – 
A Case Study on Green Hydrogen Integration in Energy Systems"*.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` → Input datasets (Excel files with technical and economic parameters).
- `code/` → Python scripts used to run simulations.
- `results/` → Simulation outputs (Excel tables and graphs).

## How to Use
1. Open the files in the `data/` folder for the base scenario inputs.
2. Scripts in `code/` can be used to replicate the simulations.
3. Full results are available in `results/`.
